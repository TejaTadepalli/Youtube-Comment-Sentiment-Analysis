@hannahmetcalf9759,I am 24 years old and was just diagnosed with Crohn‚Äôs disease for the second time. Turns out it has progressed. They told me when I was 21 that there was no sign of it anymore and that I was practically healed. But it has came back and is worst this time. I‚Äôm struggling with depression and having no energy and I stress about everything cause on top of this I‚Äôm a mom this time. The stress is going to kill me but I can stop it and I‚Äôve prayed and prayed and rebuked in the name of Jesus and it keeps coming back. My mom is also in the hospital right now she survived a perforated bowel. They lost her during surgery and it took 3 rounds of cot to get her back and I think God for that and for getting her through it. I just prayed he continues to get her through this cause she‚Äôs still in the hospital and I pray he gets her away from her abusive husband and I pray she don‚Äôt go back to him when she gets out. I definitely feel like I have a hard fought hallelujah.  I will always stand by God,0

At my lowest.
I had fought GOD my whole life.

I watched my life crumble in a way I'd never felt or could even express. 
Then about 6 weeks ago, while bed ridden, I was sobbing and I was so lost the only person I could thi k of to ask for help was him.
I wailed and begged.
I promised to give my life if he would just take the pain.
And everything changed.
In an instant. 

I never new the HOLE I was feeling was HIM missing in my life.

@alanroberts8506,"Absolutely beautiful song.

So this isn't a story I've shared with many people but as soon as I heard this song I started to weep & knew that I was supposed to.

On October 21, 2014 I was at one of the lowest points in my life. I was 25 and my father died.

I was laying in bed repeatedly calling my father's phone number just so I could hear his voice one more time. During this I felt a presence enter my room, crawl into my bed, & then wrap me up. Next thing I know I was in hell.

The smell was horrible, thinking about it literally makes my stomach turn. The darkness was different than any darkness I had ever experienced before. I could feel what felt like hands grabbing me everywhere. I then heard a faint whisper that said ""Follow the light."" Which I thought was pretty ironic because my father was an electrician. In the distance however I did see a light it was about the size of the tip of a pen from my perspective. I started walking. Stomach turning, still being touched I could hear screams that made me so uncomfortable. As I got closer to the light it got larger and what looked like a pen tip was now overwhelmingly bright and illuminating my path. The only problem was now I could see what was rubbing on me & grabbing me. I knew why the smell of sulfur, flesh, & death was so prominent. I then noticed that they hated the light & it physically hurt them. Once I got there it was so bright it hurt my eyes but then someone grabbed my hand. & before I could open my eyes to see their face. I was in Heaven, the complete opposite of what I had just gone through. I felt so much peace & comfort that it's truly hard to explain. Crazily I saw my dad and was reassured that everything was alright. I was then told that I had to leave. I didn't want to but I was told it wasn't my time. My father then looked at me, approached me, gave me a hug, said I love you & grabbed me then threw me in the air. I started falling extremely fast. I'm falling back into my body when my spirit hits my body. I sit up hyperventilating. I'm soaking wet. I actually made sure I did pee myself, which made it weirder because I didn't. Also my body was cold. I looked out the window right beside my bed and outside was death. I looked away for a second still in shock; look back & nothing was there. I've been asked several times if I think I was dreaming & my response is always it was as real as what I am doing right now.

That's my testimony of my been through hell hallelujah.. All glory to Yeshua HaMashiach.

@johnpearson1258,"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",0
