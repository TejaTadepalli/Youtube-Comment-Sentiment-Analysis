@BestgospelTV-d4f,"I am from Middle East I converted my religion. When my family learned they beat me, took my phone, laptop, bible etc. And locked me in a room for 1.5 years! I was just a 9 months old believer. When I was sitting in the room I prayed and said I don't have my Bible, my believer friends etc. how can I continue my faith? And I heard Holy spirit said I can come in this room! And he came he was with me all the time while I was in there. When I heard this song I felt someone who doesn't know my testimony made a song for me  Yes he is in the room and he'll be in the room and we can't survive without him.",1
@Prodigal_Sheep_,"Jesus saved me from depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, self-mutilation, homosexuality, and pride. I've never been beyond His reach. I've been held in his hands all my life. Even when I couldn't feel His presence, I remembered and I knew that my God is faithful and His mercy endures forever. Hallelujah! To any lost souls reading this, I hope you open your heart to the One true God who has always loved you and will save you if you ask Jesus Christ for forgiveness, obey God's two greatest commandments (1. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength 2. Love your neighbor as yourself), and if you abide in Him until your final breath. This is the narrow road He has set before us, but it leads to eternal glory and fellowship with the King of kings! Amen. ",1

@hza1203,I spent decades in the occult. Jesus came in and saved me. He delivered me into a healthy church with people that treat me like family. I witness to a lot of witches and psychic mediums so I find myself under a fair amount of attack. There are many days when I have to fight to praise. But God is mighty and good.,1
@Amazingworship-r4i,"I suffered from infertility tried for so many years to get pregnant. I always prayed to god to please bless me with a child. I was watching a mother play with her son on tik tok one day I cried and screamed to God ""God please give me a child!!!!!"" that same day something in me told me to take a pregnancy test... it came back positive! I couldnt believe it I was in tears and in shock!I took more pregnancy tests and they all came back positive!  A week after I found out I was pregnant I found a cross necklace a few steps away from where I worked at and I then knew it was really God all along and never left my side. I now have a 11 month healthy beautiful baby boy. He's turning 1 in a few days!  God is good!",1

-,"I was a homeless drug addict for over a decade. I still remember sleeping on a cardboard box under a bridge, chipping the ice off my socks during the winter. I was a 3 time convicted felon looking at life behind bars in. I still remember that soft whisper spoke to me in the dead of night in December of 2012 telling me to surrender. Since then I’ve watched God take every single thing that the enemy used to destroy me and turn it around for the good. I’ve been in recovery for over a decade now and am happily married with a beautiful family. They get to travel the world with me as I share my own songs and testimony through music at various treatment centers, correctional facilities and other venues. The first people in line at my hometown show were my old correctional officers that used to lock me up every night when I was in prison. It’s definitely been a hard fought hallelujah but He has been true and faithful to every one of His promises. For anyone out there struggling, surrender and give your life wholeheartedly to Jesus. In return He will give you a life more abundant than you could ever imagine. ️‍️",1

@EricSimon-c3l,"My aunt loved to sing to my kids every night. In a small town nestled between rolling hills, there lived a girl named Emma who often felt lost and alone. Every day after school, she wandered to a quaint little church at the edge of town, seeking solace in its warm embrace. It was her refuge, a place where echoes of faith filled the air, comforting her weary heart. They sang of love that conquers fear, of grace that heals, and of dreams that soar. With every note, Emma felt her worries fade away, replaced by the promise of something greater. The choir’s music began to reach beyond the church, spreading hope throughout the town. They performed at local events, touching lives and bringing people together. Emma noticed the smiles that lit up faces as the music played, realizing the profound impact of their message. One evening, while practicing under a starry sky, Emma reflected on her journey. She felt a deep sense of belonging, knowing they were shining a light for others to find their way. Inspired by her experiences, Emma started to write her own songs, weaving her feelings into lyrics about faith, resilience, and hope. With her friends’ encouragement, she began to perform her songs during choir events, sharing her story with the world. The more she sang, the more her spirit lifted, transforming pain into purpose. As the seasons changed, so did Emma. She blossomed into a beacon of light in her community, using her voice to uplift those who felt lost. The little church became a hub of hope, where people gathered not just to listen but to share their own stories of struggle and triumph. Together, they sang not only of faith but also of love, friendship, and the beauty of new beginnings. Through the power of music, Emma found her voice and her purpose, inspiring others to embrace their journeys with courage. The melodies that once filled her heart with longing now resonated with joy, reminding everyone that no matter how dark the night, the dawn will always break, bringing the promise of a new day filled with hope and love. Emma’s story became a testament to the transformative power of faith and community, showing that through music, lives can be changed, hearts can heal, and dreams can come alive. As she looked around at her friends, she knew that together they were creating a symphony of hope, one note at a time. I lost my husband and moved in with my aunt when things went bad for us Kelvin owes all my gratitude to you for changing my life from being homeless to owning a home. help me thank her in prayers Feedback@kelvinpro . com These are the exact lyrics she sang to my kids every night.!!",1

@MattiBoyle-d8h,"We welcomed our second baby boy in March this year. Not long after he was born I could tell his body was hurting him. By week three I was taking him to doctors/specialists multiple times a week, including multiple visits to the ER. Everyone told us it was colic. At four months we took him back to the ER and requested an EEG. Two weeks later he was diagnosed with a rare genetic condition called MED17 & we were told they believe he only has 1-2 years to live. I had the opportunity to go to a Summer Worship Night concert and you gave a little sneak peek of this song. Miracle child and Hard Fought Hallelujah have been my anthem this year. Thankful we serve a powerful and merciful God who STILL does MIRACLES I’ll bring my hard fought heart felt been through hell hallelujah.",1

@StacieGosnell,"This song right here  I played the clips over and over in the hospital watching the monitors while my husband was there, he just had a massive heart at 39. He coded on the table brought back after 5 minutes. Sedated from Friday to Monday ... Praising the Lord for his healing before the healing came. Believing God for a miracle. This song was released today on his birthday! He's home with us and getting better everyday! This clip over and over played when I didn't have any more words left to give. 

I'll bring my hard-fought, heartfelt
Been-through-hell Hallelujah
And I'll bring my storm-tossed, torn-sail
Story to tell Hallelujah
'Cause God you've been patient
God you've been gracious
Faithful whatever I'm feeling or facing
So I'll bring my hard-fought, heartfelt
It is well Hallelujah",1
@reneetaylor3766,"I am 43 years old and have struggled with religion for years and this is the first time I have raised my hands in praise since I was a small kid.

@auntsoniat,"My heart and soul needed this song. I got out of church when I was taking care of my mom, but I still watched online every Sunday. In November of 2023, I lost my brother. Then just 75 days later, my mom died. Slowly, without even realizing it, my faith started to waver. I never got back into church and I no longer watched online. I still listened to Christian music, along with other genres. Then I heard a clip of this song on TikTok and something stirred inside of me. I don't think I've truly ""felt"" anything since losing my mom. I've been waiting for the release of this song and it's been on repeat ever since. I can't stop crying while listening. Every time I listen something else in the song strikes a chord. It's allowing me to feel again. Yes, it's bringing up a lot of painful memories from losing my dad 23 years ago to my brother and mom in the last year and the many health problems I personally have. BUT, in the end it's an IT IS WELL HALLELUJAH. God knows it was hard fought, but it is well with my soul. Thank you Brandon Lake for this song, and thank you Lord for giving him the message to spread.",1

@JesusChristaboveallbeneathnone,"🥹🥹🥹I LITERALLY CANNOT STOP PLAYING THIS SONG! I keep starting it over, this song is the type of song you play and get on your knees with your hands lifted with no words and let the tears just stream down your face and let this song speak on your behalf! This song makes me think about EVERYTHING that Jesus Christ of Nazareth has brought me through and out of! All of the things He has protected me from that I couldn’t see! All I can say is that I love Jesus Christ of Nazareth and I never felt real authentic true love until I got closer to HimWords can NEVER describe the love and passion I have for Jesus Christ of Nazareth, BUT He knows and that is all that matters! Thank you Jesus Christ of Nazareth for loving someone like me and being patient and kind towards me! I am and forever will be grateful to call you my Lord of Lord, King of Kings, my savior! Psalm 100 “Make a joyful shout to the Lord, all you lands! Serve the Lord with gladness; Come before His presence with singing. Know that the Lord, He is God; It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; We are His people and the sheep of His pasture. Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, And into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, and bless His name. For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting, And His truth endures to all generations.” DON’T EVER LEAVE ME, I CANNOT LIVE LIFE WITHOUT YOU BY MY SIDE JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH, YOU’RE MY BEST FRIEND! YOUR WILL BE DONE IN ALL AREAS OF MY LIFE AND NOT MY OWN! You continue to remind me everyday, “For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.” ️",1

He chose your music specifically for my soul because he knows how much music hits me to my core. My 37 year old daughter hasn't seen her children in 8 years because of drug addiction.  She just celebrated 5 years clean but is struggling with depression and anxiety.  Gods giving me the words to get her through a tough time right now.  I'm breaking generational curses I didn't even know were there. Praise be to my heavenly father, addiction stops here with me.

I remember going outside the building dropping to my knees and just screaming. There was tears stained on my lease papers. My pastor came straight away and found me on the ground. I just remember saying while crying god is still good god is still good. Somehow i managed to keep my faith through it all. Almost lost myself to an alcohol addiction shortly after.. BUT GOD!

It has been a roller coaster but God has shown me his love on a way not even the devil can take away. I have always earned to love him the way he loves me then I came across the power filled Christian artist called “Brandon Lake” it was his song gratitude that God used to fire his love in me and he’s been with me showing me his different shades of his love and I’m honored to be in his presence even though he’s still seeing me some challenges but he’s always there, it’s amazingly cool to be a Christian.",1

You know how in Rocky 3 Apollo Creed says to Rocky, ""There is no tomorrow! There is no tomorrow! There is no tomorrow!"" I've been struggling for six years in a trial with a lot things and I just know that going through the fire with God is worth fighting, no matter how many punches or kicks I get by the devil. Each day it takes a daily surrender towards God to be a servant towards God and people while getting over your pride and sacrificing your selfishness, dieing to self each day. Thank you sir for your music as you use your gift for God that he has given you. Jesus is Christ, Lord, Savior, King over all, lamb and Lion and the Son of God. I will keep on following him and persevere through the trials. God bless you brothers and sisters. Thank you Brandon Lake.",1

Yeah I don't always feel it
But that's when I need it the most
So I'mma keep on singing
'Til my soul catches up with my song

There's times when my hands go up freely
And times that it costs
There's days when a praise comes out easy
And days when it takes all the strength I've got

I'll bring my hard-fought, heartfelt
Been-through-hell Hallelujah
And I'll bring my storm-tossed, torn-sail
Story to tell Hallelujah
'Cause God you've been patient
God you've been gracious
Faithful whatever I'm feeling or facing
So I'll bring my hard-fought, heartfelt
It is well Hallelujah
Oh oh oh oh, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

I've wrestled with the darkness
But I'm trying to reach for the light
Yeah the struggle keeps me honest
And it breaks down the walls of my pride

Cause faith isn't proven like gold
'Til it's been through the fire
My head, heart and hands are feeling heavy
But that's when I lift them just a little higher

I'll bring my hard-fought, heartfelt
Been-through-hell Hallelujah
I'll bring my storm-tossed, torn-sail
Story to tell Hallelujah
God you've been patient
God you've been gracious
Faithful whatever I'm feeling or facing
I'll bring my hard-fought, heartfelt
It is well Hallelujah
Oh oh oh oh, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

I'll bring my hard-fought, heartfelt
Been-through-hell Hallelujah
I'll bring my storm-tossed, torn-sail
Story to tell Hallelujah

@musicandmania,"I'm that girl who washed up at rock bottom a few times and crawls into the empty side of the pews Sunday mornings because the only thing I can do is show up for the One that still has cards to play for me even when I fold. I feel like I'm bare knuckle brawling with it sometimes and sometimes even with Jesus, because I know he saved me and called me but I still haven't figured out why or for what. I sit at home in my cluttered 1 bedroom apartment in isolation where I went through the worst years of my life and suffered psychosis and died a few times. Most days all I do is try. I admittedly have days I don't try at all and find myself curled up and hiding, but with one tiny ounce of faith. Some days I have enough faith to even spread it to others, some days I don't have a single ounce of faith but instead only a shaky act of thanks. And I read my Bible looking for that one lighthouse moment where it all pieces together but I don't always find it. I have no idea why I'm still breathing and no one else knows either, except for the simple fact that Jesus saved me; on those nights when I couldn't fight for my life Someone Else did. And I don't know what I'm doing or where I'm going... But there's a God who knows my path already and sees me grappling with my flesh and my mind and sees my heart when all I have to offer him is a choked up Hallelujah. On Sundays I hang over the pew and leave a puddle of tears as my only repayment i can give, because going up to the altar takes more strength and the tears puddling below my feet feel more genuine and more easy than the tense posture my flesh will fight me for when I demand it surrender for the hundredth time. I am a walking testimony that Jesus hears your hallelujah when it sounds a lot more like ""idk why I'm here but I showed up"". When your joy is hard to find and it's not so much a shout of victory but sounds more like a battlecry, He hears your hallelujah. I'm a walking testimony that those nights you've spent lying in bed suffering and praying never even crosses your mind, He hears that anyway. Those years you spent denying yourself and saying you were too far gone for God I promise He hears that too. Some people make it so glorious to watch their faith in Christ like they have it all put together and never doubt their faith, those people that seem better  than us. They make it look so easy to praise and worship. I know might feel like you are inherently broken, there's something wrong with you, or aren't doing it right. Maybe you don't actually believe you're worthy, because you can't praise and worship and shout and pray like everyone else.. But I'm proof that a hallelujah can look more like a desperate wailing and that those trenches you are crawling out of are not forever. and that one undeniable glimmer of ""it'll be okay"" in your head comes from Jesus. If all you can do is show up for Jesus, that's all he asks of you right now. He will never give up on you even when you gave up a long time ago. If the only thing you have to give is a choked up ""thank you for helping me wake up this morning"" , that's a good enough hallelujah for him today, I promise you that he will never forsake someone giving the only thing they have, who has very little to give. We are all a walking promise that there's something more to us than suffering and if it takes a long time for us to find it that's okay. But don't ever give up. Don't underestimate what Jesus can do with us, even if all we have to offer him is our one shaky hallelujah. Just keep showing up He hears you. 

Mark 12:42-44 is about a widow who offered what she had to give; Jesus knew she didn't have much and valued this act of devotion more than what those who had a lot to give. 

Matthew 26:6-13 is about a woman who had expensive perfume, and she poured it over Jesus' head. This was a huge deal because the woman could have sold that for money, it was very valuable. But she poured it over Jesus instead, knowing His day was coming and more important. That was the most valuable possession she likely had and traded it to glorify and honor Jesus instead. Jesus even said that this was beautiful and would be a story told among the gospel.",1
@NickTheSlav,"Jesus is the best guide, teacher, and friend I could ever absolutely ask for. I’m never ever ever alone. And if I start feeling lonely I lean on that FACT. I LEAN ON CHRIST. I get goosebumps just thinking about it. 52 days SOBER and I am so grateful for the hell I PUT MYSELF IN because it pushed me to seek GOD more than ever. I commit my life to God now.

Trying my best, but always falling short, but the LORD never let me go and is so gracious! I have met my soul mate after being in an emotionally abusive marriage for years.  I never thought I would marry again… but I have a beautiful dress hanging in my closet saying something else. We both feel that our heavenly FATHER was our matchmaker. I still have trials, praying that the tumor on my brain has remained dormant, but looking forward to making memories with my true love.",1

@RpgCrow,"This song speaks to me on a very personal level
As much as I like to paint that being Christian is awesome, which it is.
I've been walking this path for almost 3 years now I was an atheist first 30 years of my life and I can say
it is also a very hard path and you will face many storms you fight to deny yourself, to strengthen yourself your mind body and spirit all while life is trying it's hardest to knock you down and sometimes life does knock you down, sometimes you do give in to that temptation and sometimes it's hard, very hard to praise the lord.
But when it's hard that's the time you need him the most.

It's easy to praise and worship when life is going well.
But when life knocks you down that's when you gotta pray that little bit harder.",1

@phumiebiyela9694,"Had emergency open heart surgery this year. My aortic valve burst so the blood wasn't pumping out of the heart causing it to expand. Had aortic valve replacement surgery. I didn't take well to the medication provided and would throw up all day, could eat, drink anything or sleep for almost 4 months. Prayer saved me. Jesus saved me. I got a prophetic word while in hospital that I should share my story and everything else I've been through in life as this is my testimony. I believe that surgery is what brought me closer to God. I thank him everyday for my life. Looking forward to next year as I start theology school and spread the good news!

Controlling and abusive relationships, friends that stabbed me in my back and people that  hurt me then trashed my name. It all could have turned me dark but a bad accident brought me to God. He took things and people out of my life. I'm alone but really its a blessing because God is letting me know im safe with him and to just know he has something really beautiful in store for me. In the meantime he is with me and teaching me how to be a better verson of myself and how to stick up for myself. He saved me from everything that was meant to destroy me. And when I cry from all the hurt he is there to comfort me. He is my only strength. Hallelujah",1

Brandon Lake
Explicit
Yeah, I don't always feel it
Yeah, but that's when I need it the most
So, I'ma keep on singing
'Til my soul catches up with my song

There's times when my hands go up freely
And times that it costs, oh-oh
There's days when a praise comes out easy
Days when it takes all the strength I got

I'll bring my hard-fought, heartfelt
Been-through-hell hallelujah (ooh, ooh)
And I'll bring my storm-tossed, torn-sail
Story-to-tell hallelujah, oh
'Cause God, You've been patient
God, You've been gracious
Faithful, whatever I'm feeling or facing
So I'll bring my hard-fought, heartfelt, it-is-well hallelujah, whoa-oh
Hallelujah (ooh, ooh), hallelujah

I've wrestled with the darkness
But I'm tryin' to reach for the light
Yeah, the struggle keeps me honest
And it breaks down the walls of my pride

'Cause faith isn't proven like gold
'Til it's been through the fire, eh-eh
My head, heart, and hands are feeling heavy
But that's when I lift them just a little higher

I'll bring my hard-fought, heartfelt
Been-through-hell hallelujah (ooh, ooh)
I'll bring my storm-tossed, torn-sail
Story-to-tell hallelujah, whoa-oh
God, You've been patient
God, You've been gracious
Faithful, whatever I'm feeling or facing
I'll bring my hard-fought, heartfelt, it-is-well hallelujah, oh
Hallelujah, hallelujah (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh, oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh, oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

I'll bring my hard-fought, heartfelt
Been-through-hell hallelujah (hallelujah)
I'll bring my storm-tossed, torn-sail
Story-to-tell hallelujah, whoa-oh
God, You've been patient
And God, You've been gracious
Faithful, whatever I'm feeling or facing
I'll bring my hard-fought, heartfelt, it-is-well hallelujah (ooh)
Oh, hallelujah (mm, eh-ah, eh)
Hallelujah

Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Hallelujah, hallelujah, halle-

@Julia_goolia,"Today I cried to The Lord because of gratitude. I haven’t been grateful and today He tugged on my heart. I was JUST in the bathroom crying falling to my knees (which I haven’t done so in a while).. I thanked Him for everything and prayed for His Mercy over the struggles that my loved ones go through… Then I heard this song play. It was like a whisper to my ears. I had very loud songs playing earlier, but this time it was like a whisper. I came out and I cannot believe what a powerful prayer this is. This isn’t a song this is pure worship and gratitude. I turned up my speaker so high and felt like I wrote this song. Came from my heart. The Holy Spirit brought out what I was holding in for so long through this worship. 
JESUS YOU ARE SO GOOD I DO NOT DESERVE YOU… YET YOU ARE THE I AM. AND YOU LOVE A WRETCHED SINNER LIKE ME. 
Thank you Jesus. I give You my cross, Lord. I give You my glory. HALLELUJAH. Holy Spirit Thank You.",1

@nikarose,"I guy I worked with was born and raised Muslim. Marries a Christian woman (Eastern Orthodox). Could not have kids for over a decade. This was 40 years ago.  Went to all the doctors. All the imams. Did everything they could. They finally go to a small Eastern Orthodox church in Belgrade, Serbia. She is praying there, talking to the priest. My colleague went in with her and just waiting for her. As he is standing there he thinks ""God, if you give me a child I will baptize them in Eastern Orthodox church"". They had twin girls a year later. They were baptizes in the same church he made a promise to God.",1
